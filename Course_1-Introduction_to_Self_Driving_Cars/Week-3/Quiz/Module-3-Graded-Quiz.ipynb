A computer vision failure restricts the vehicle's ability to navigate the environment around it, hence a problem with this system is a serious failure. However, LiDAR and radar sense similar environment data, so a computer vision failure does not leave the vehicle completely blind. A Computer vision algorithm failure can be considered a somewhat severe failure as it decreases vehicle sensing ability and it gets a severity score of 5. This could happen regularly in low light situations, hence the occurrence number is assigned 4. Computer vision algorithm failure is fairly detectable in majority of the situations, so the detectability score is 3.\n",
